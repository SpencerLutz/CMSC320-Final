    "[Clash Royale](https://clashroyale.com/) is a free-to-play real-time strategy mobile game released by [Supercell](https://supercell.com/). After the success of their game [Clash of Clans](https://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/), they released Clash Royale in early 2016 using many of the same characters, items, and mechanics. In a match of Clash Royale, each player selects a deck of 8 'cards'. Each card corresponds to a character with unique stats and abilities. These cards cost 'elixir' to use, a currency that slowly replenishes throughout the match. The goal of the game is to use your cards to simultaneously destroy the opponent's towers and defend your own. Each player has a 'King Tower' which is flanked by two 'Princess Towers'. The player who destroys their opponent's 'King Tower' first wins. If time runs out, the player who has destroyed more of their opponent's Princess Towers wins."

    "There are many different types of matches that occur in Clash Royale, but I will be focusing on Ladder matches. The Ladder, also known as Trophy Road, is the central focus of the game, making up most of the player's progression. Ladder matches are 1v1 matches in which the winner wins 'trophies' and the loser loses trophies. Players start with 0 trophies, and they gain more by winning matches. The Ladder is divided into 20 arenas, which players unlock by reaching a certain number of trophies (e.g. Arena 1 requires 0 trophies, Arena 2 requires 300, ... Arena 20 requires 7500). When a player unlocks a new arena, they also unlock 4 to 8 new cards that they can add to their deck. At the start of Arena 1, the player only has 8 cards available, so every deck is the same; however, as more cards are unlocked, decks become very customizable."

    "Currently, I am in Arena 15, but I have been using the same deck since Arena 7. It used to perform quite well, but now it's outdated, so my progress has begun to stagnate. There are dozens more cards available to me now, so I wanted to create a new deck, but decision anxiety is preventing me from committing to anything. How would I know if a deck is good enough? Should I use a popular deck or create my own? What if switching out a couple cards would make me the best player in the world? The best way to answer these questions is through data."

    "There aren't a lot of datasets out there for Clash Royale matches, and the ones that exist are very outdated. This is an issue because Supercell recently [released](https://clashroyale.com/blog/release-notes/new-update-october-2022.html) new cards and mechanics, which would have meaningful effects on the data and conclusions. Thus, I chose to create my own by scraping Clash Royale's [developer API](https://developer.clashroyale.com/#/). This will allow me to get data on millions of matches from the past few days alone."

    "In Clash Royale, players can join a 'Clan' - a group of players that trade cards, chat, and fight wars against other Clans. My initial approach was to loop through hundreds of clans, get every player in each clan, and then scan their recent matches for Ladder matches fought since the most recent [balancing update](https://clashroyale.com/blog/release-notes/balance-changes.html) (December 7). (*Note: there was an update on December 11 that included a small balance change to one card, but since this was a very small change and I wanted to maximize data, I chose to include matches both before and after this update.*)"
