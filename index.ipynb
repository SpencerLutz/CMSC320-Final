    "[Clash Royale](https://clashroyale.com/) is a free-to-play real-time strategy mobile game released by [Supercell](https://supercell.com/). After the success of their game [Clash of Clans](https://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/), they released Clash Royale in early 2016 using many of the same characters, items, and mechanics. In a match of Clash Royale, each player selects a deck of 8 'cards'. Each card corresponds to a character with unique stats and abilities. These cards cost 'elixir' to use, a currency that slowly replenishes throughout the match. The goal of the game is to use your cards to simultaneously destroy the opponent's towers and defend your own. Each player has a 'King Tower' which is flanked by two 'Princess Towers'. The player who destroys their opponent's 'King Tower' first wins. If time runs out, the player who has destroyed more of their opponent's Princess Towers wins."

    "There are many different types of matches that occur in Clash Royale, but I will be focusing on Ladder matches. The Ladder, also known as Trophy Road, is the central focus of the game, making up most of the player's progression. Ladder matches are 1v1 matches in which the winner wins 'trophies' and the loser loses trophies. Players start with 0 trophies, and they gain more by winning matches. The Ladder is divided into 20 arenas, which players unlock by reaching a certain number of trophies (e.g. Arena 1 requires 0 trophies, Arena 2 requires 300, ... Arena 20 requires 7500). When a player unlocks a new arena, they also unlock 4 to 8 new cards that they can add to their deck. At the start of Arena 1, the player only has 8 cards available, so every deck is the same; however, as more cards are unlocked, decks become very customizable."

    "Currently, I am in Arena 15, but I have been using the same deck since Arena 7. It used to perform quite well, but now it's outdated, so my progress has begun to stagnate. There are dozens more cards available to me now, so I wanted to create a new deck, but decision anxiety is preventing me from committing to anything. How would I know if a deck is good enough? Should I use a popular deck or create my own? What if switching out a couple cards would make me the best player in the world? The best way to answer these questions is through data."

I first get a good number of matches using the approach above, but instead of saving the original data, I get the player tag and trophy count. I then use these values to get a tag for one player in every 100-trophy interval. Once I have these tags, I run a modified BFS (Depth-Limited BFS? Is that a thing?) on their battles. I first add these initial tags to a queue, and for each one, I get the tags for every player they've fought a battle against. I add each of these players to a separate queue and do the same thing for that queue, making sure to avoid duplicate players. This means the number of players I can query isn't limited by the API, and because players fight matches against other players of similar trophy count, I will likely get a much more even distribution of data."

Then I request the list of clans as before, but this time, instead of a high minimum member count, I choose a low minimum score. A clan's score is based on the trophy count of its members, so this will prevent us from ruling out players with fewer than 1000 trophies, who are less likely to be in a clan. I loop through these, and for the same reasons as mentioned prior, I make sure that the clan has a minimum trophy requirement of 0. I then go through each member and check if they are part of an interval for which a player is needed, as well as if they have any recent battles to spider from. I then add this player's tag to the `players` dictionary."
